# data not found

> "I have been trying, for about the last twenty years, to link the following three dimensions: lived experience, technologies [...], and silences." - [Susan Leigh Star](https://www.are.na/block/15642139)

> "'Missing data sets' are the blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated. Wherever large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live." – [Mimi Ọnụọha](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets)

_data not found_ is a dataset of datasets that were sought but not found on data portals around the world.

Archiving unmet data desires and lingering concerns, it invites reflection on which datasets are not collected or made public, and which kinds of questions remain unanswerable as a result.

Rather than assuming a ["data universalism"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476419837739), these queries reveal some of the different ways in which data comes to matter.

What is considered ["missing data"](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets), a ["data gap"](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2018/data_revolution) or a ["data void"](https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/) is contingent, relational and situational.

## caveats

These as-yet-unsuccessful requests have been selected from data portals around the world to illustrate a range of concerns, curiosities and queries for data that is not collected or made public. They are not intended to be representative of all requests on all portals.

Not all data portals make requests and responses to these requests available. Not all unsuccessful data requests have been included (e.g. those containing personal details, duplicate requests, requests which are redirected).
